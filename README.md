# TicTacToe AI first trying of Min-Max Algorithm

First implementation trys of a MinMax Algorithm in TicTacToe.

- First implemented a basic TicTacToe Game (not the best, it can crash, but my main goal is the AI)
- Implementing an AI
  - If first move, allways place in the middle (5)
  - Providing the rules, to directly win or block a possible win
  - Else the MinMax Algorithm
 
Algorithm is working, but there is room for improvment in the runtime.
